    Word Shuffle is an exciting word finding game.  Twenty-five letters are randomly distributed over a 5x5 matrix.
    Your objective is to make as many words as possible with adjacent letters used only once.  You can connect letters
    to the left and right, up and down, and even diagonally, but you can only touch a given letter once as you create
    the word.<br><br>
