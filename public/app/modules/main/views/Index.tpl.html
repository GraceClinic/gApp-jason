        And now this text displays once "ui.router" loads the Main_Views_Index template per the URL state.  This template
        also loads the Index controller. From this point on, the controller can effect display of content to the screen.
        Controllers are the scaffolding for your web application and Models are the work engines.  Open your Firebug
        console and take a look at the logged events to see what is going on in the background.
