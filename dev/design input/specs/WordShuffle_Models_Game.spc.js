/**
 * WordShuffle_Models_Game Class
 *
 * Implements the WordShuffle game.  This constructor excludes all appropriate properties from requests to the
 * backend by itemizing in the "excludeFromPost" array and it set the rootURL for the backend data source.  In
 * addition, this method sets a watcher against "keypress" events.  If the keyed pressed is the ENTER key, the
 * watcher fires the "submitWord" method.

/**
 * @method   submitWord
 * Submit word to backend for processing if word length > 1 and the state is active.  This method is simply

 * update the UI.  Upon return from the backend, the associated post-relay method must post the "msg"
 * contained in the result to the "word" property.  This will typically be "SUCCESS!" or "REJECTED!".
 * The method must also clear all of the selected Squares contained within "wordSquares" and empty the array.

 *    {boolean}   oResults.newRound         - flags start of new round
 *
 * Given the above information, this method will update the Game state and newRound flag with the
 * corresponding result property.  It will also update the "scoreBoard" property and update the points for
 * the active Round with "roundPoints".  If the Game state is COMPLETED or ABANDONED, this method will
 * stop the clock.  In addition, if the response flags "newRound", the method will stop the Clock and
 * execute an immediate Game.save operation.  As soon as the save returns, the method will start the Clock.

/**
 * DETAILED SPECIFICATION
 *
 * This is the workhorse model for the entire WordShuffle game.  The backend plays a large role validating the game
 * play.  As with every model within a dynamic web application, there is logic handled by the frontend application
 * and there is logic handled by the backend application.  There are properties relevant to and controlled by the
 * frontend application and vice-versa.  It is paramount to Game functionality that the frontend and backend
 * applications do their designated jobs.  The frontend controls UI and general game functionality linked therein.
 * The backend provides retrieval and save of data as well as the business rules dictating proper play.  Business
 * logic can and should be embedded in the frontend; however, the backend cannot simply trust information received
 * from the frontend.  It must validate and control properties that are not to be manipulated by the frontend.
 *
 * BUSINESS LOGIC ON SAVE
 * The backend validates the game state on every save event and processes the state.  On construction of the Game
 * model by the backend, the logic checks the following:
 * 1) It removes all properties passed from the frontend that are not allowed to be set by the
 * frontend.  Those properties are the following:  'round', 'start', 'end', 'points', 'idPlayer', 'roundAvg',
 * 'scoreBoard', 'Rounds', and 'state'.  The frontend application should have excluded these properties from post, but
 * URL mashing must be handled.  The frontend is passive in regards to these properties, it cannot set these properties.
 * Some of these properties derive from the session variables controlled by SysMan, others are updated by the backend
 * based on the current game state.
 * 2) It validates the "signInState" stored in SysMan->Session and sets the state to ANONYMOUS_PLAY if the state is
 * not SIGNED_IN.  This explicitly identifies anonymous play if the user has not authenticated.
 * 3) Reviews the "newGame" flag and determines if game state allows new game (i.e. game not IN_PROGRESS).  It new
 * game allowed, it resets the SysMan->Session->idGame to 0, which insures the save operation will result in the
 * creation of a new game as opposed to an update.  In all cases, it sets its "id" to that stored in session as
 * SysMan->Session->idGame.  This is because the session is the keeper of this information no matter what.
 * 4) If there is currently and active game, the logic will insure that the game settings do not change.  Specifically,
 * that is "roundsPerGame" and "secondsPerRound".  The player cannot change this information during an active game.
 * If there is an attempt to do so, the Game.msg records a "INFO" type message to the player indicating that such
 * a change is not allowed.  The frontend will display this to the player.
 * 5) Since the Game object must support ANONYMOUS_PLAY, the SysMan->Session must store and maintain the array of
 * Rounds for the active game.  The Game->Rounds array of Rounds must derive from this information.  If the player
 * state is SIGNED_IN, then Round information will save to the database and update the SysMan->Session storage as
 * appropriate.
 * 6) After construction, regardless as to whether the save creates a new record or updates an existing record, it
 * must validate the game state based logic explained the the PROCESS GAME STATE section.
 *
 * PROCESS GAME STATE
 * 1) If it is a new Game, the model resets the SysMan->Session->idGame to 0 and sets the SysMan->Session->round
 * to 1.  It will also initialized the Game properties for a new game:  "start" to current date time,
 * "points" to 0, "roundAvg" to 0, empty the "scoreBoard" array, "word" to an empty string, and set "state" to
 * IN_PROGRESS.  The Game object also creates new Rounds to service the game per the "roundsPerGame" and
 * "secondsPerRound".  The first round "start" and "end" properties are set accordingly.  The Game proceeds to
 * search the database records for any uncompleted games for the player.  If it finds these, it sets these to
 * ABANDONED.  Finally, since it is a new Game, all Squares are set to a new random letter based on the LETTER FREQUENCY
 * shown below.  The new Squares are written to SysMan->Session->Squares for validation later against submitted
 * words.
 * 2) If the Game is IN_PROGRESS, then it verifies if the Round has ended.  If true, then it verifies if the game
 * has ended.  If yes, it sets the game state as COMPLETED and "end" to the current datetime stamp.  If the game is
 * not completed, it saves the current Round, sets the "newRound" flag, increments the active "round" (also, the
 * SysMan->Session->round memory), sets the new active Round's "start" and "end" properties and saves it, and
 * empties the "scoreBoard".  Since it is a new Round, all Squares are set to a new randow letter based on the LETTER
 * FREQUENCY shown below.  The new Squares are written to SysMan->Session->Squares for validation later against
 * submitted words.
 *
 * After successful save, if Game state is COMPLETED, post "Game Over" to the "word" property.  Otherwise, if it is
 * a new round or a new game, start the Clock, set the "word" to "???", and reset the newGame and newRound flags.
 *
 * BUSINESS LOGIC ON SUBMIT WORD
 * For the frontend, the submitWord method is largely a relay method to the backend for processing.  The backend
 * applies the validation logic for word submission and returns the response as described in the "submitWord" method
 * above.  Upon submit of word, if the game state is active, the method will always execute the PROCESS GAME STATE
 * as described above.  Submissions should only occur when game state is IN_PROGRESS.  The backend will process
 * the word and build a response object based on the processing results.  The Game validates the following:
 * 1) The word consist of a minimum of 2 letters.  If it does not, the method records Game->msg INFO type message
 * that the word is too short.  The frontend must disallow submission of anything less that 2 letters, but the
 * backend must still check for thoroughness.
 * 2) The Game validates that the word recorded within "wordSquares" matches a valid letter pattern within the
 * SysMan->Session->Squares matrix saved to session memory.  If it does not, it sets the response.success as false
 * and records "Board Mismatch!" to response.msg.  It will do the same if "word" does not match with the letter pattern
 * derived from the "wordSquares" queue.
 * 3) If the submitted word matches with an existing word submitted previously, it records response.success as false
 * and "Duplicate!" to response.txt.
 * 4) If it passes the above, it validates the word with the database dictionary.  If the word exists, it records
 * true to response.success and "Success!" to response.msg.  If it does not, it records false to response.success
 * and "Rejected!" to response.msg.
