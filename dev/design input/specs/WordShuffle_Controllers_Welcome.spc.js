/**
 * DETAILED SPECIFICATION
 *
 * This controller services the "Welcome" tab of the application.  Once the specific controller template loads, it must
 * instantiate this controller.  That template will also bind the appCommonDirectivesBanner directive and pass its
 * "msg" property as input to the directive.  The specification for this template is found within the
 * WordShuffle_Views_Welcome.tpl.html wireframe page.
 *
 * The controller only supports one action:  index.  When the URL specifies this action, the controller will provide
 * information from the Instructions property as specified in the WordShuffle_Views_Welcome_Index.tpl.html wireframe
 * page.
