This directory contains application tests. These could be hand-written, PHPUnit tests, Selenium-RC based tests or based
on some other testing framework. By default, library code can be tested by mimicking the directory structure of your
library/ directory. Additionally, functional tests for your application could be written mimicking the application/
directory structure (including the application subdirectory)
